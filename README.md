Convert Minecraft Resource Packs to Texture Packs

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/vv9mxuq9o7xgvjbi?branch=main&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/craftycodie/spritecaster)

## What is SpriteCaster?
SpriteCaster allows you to convert modern minecraft textures for release versions into texture packs compatible with older versions. It essentially allows you to backport resource packs. 

For example, if you wanted to play Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 using Faithless, you're out of luck since Faithless is a new resource pack and didn't exist back in beta. SpriteCaster allows you to convert Faithless, or any modern resource pack to Beta 1.7.3, or any old version.
